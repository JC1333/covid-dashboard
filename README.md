# covid-dashboard
univeristy coursework for module ECM1400

This is a python program that runs a flask website that shows news articles and covid statistics.
It will show the covid statistics for a nation and the local area alongside news articles related to covid.
The nation and local area can be changed by specifying within the config file.
However it will be limited to the UK due to it relying on the publichealthengland api.

It specifically uses the NewsAPI and Cov19API by newsapi.org and publichealthengland.github.io/ respectivly.


I may develop this further however if i do it will take a long time due to study being my primary focus.
